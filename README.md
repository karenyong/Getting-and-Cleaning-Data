**Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

Steps to work on this course project include:

1. Download the UCI HAR Dataset data source.

2. Complete steps listed below and save to run_analysis.R and use this script to generate a tidy data set called Tidy.txt.

3. Ensure that steps taken to generate Tidy.txt are documented in Codebook.md.

4. Include a README.md which explains how the scripts work and are connected.

5. Upload run_analysis.R, Codebook.md and README.md to Github repository.

Create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
